        I'm Marko, an 18 year old Roblox scripter and animator. I've been
        developing seriously for 3 years now, and in those 3 years I've made
        plenty of scripts/animations. This portfolio contains some of the
        scripts I think would be able to show my experience with the Roblox API
        and the Luau language the best. I've also included a few animations i've
        made recently. All animations/vfx/scripts are made by me.
